- **Strategies to prevent budget overruns**:
  - Detailed budget estimation at the start.
  - Continuous cost tracking and variance analysis.
  - Prioritization of essential features (scope control).
  - Flexible budget adjustments for unforeseen issues.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
- **Agile**:
  - **Advantages**: Flexibility, continuous feedback, and iterative development.
  - **Disadvantages**: Can be hard to scale, less predictable deadlines.
- **Waterfall**:
  - **Advantages**: Clear structure, well-documented process, easier for fixed-scope projects.
  - **Disadvantages**: Inflexible to changes, late-stage feedback issues.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
- **Agile**: Beneficial for dynamic, evolving projects (e.g., app development, startups).
- **Waterfall**: Better for projects with clear, fixed requirements (e.g., large infrastructure software like ERPs).

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
- **Methods**:
  - Regular testing (unit, integration, system).
  - Code reviews.
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- High standards ensure product reliability, user satisfaction, and minimize future maintenance costs.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
- **Defining scope** clarifies deliverables, expectations, and resource needs.
- **WBS**: A hierarchical breakdown of tasks, helping with task assignment, cost estimation, and progress tracking.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
- **Benefits**:
  - Provides a roadmap for task completion.
  - Identifies critical tasks and deadlines.
  - Helps in resource planning.
- **Gantt charts**: Visual timelines that show task dependencies and progress, helping with tracking and coordination.
